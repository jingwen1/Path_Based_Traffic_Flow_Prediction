# Path-Based Traffic Flow Prediction

This repository is the Paper Ready version of my thesis. You can find analytical information about my thesis [here](https://github.com/stratoskar/Traffic_Flow_Prediction/)

## Repository Overview

- **Objective:** We are trying to predict the forthcoming traffic flow volume for specific routes within San Francisco, California, leveraging insights gleaned from historical data.
- **Methodology:** We perform time series forecasting using machine and deep learning models. We use the Strict Path Queries paper to measure traffic flow in each path accurately.
- **Data:** The process to generate the final dataset is described in the code files inside the Python_Code folder. The files have increment numbers that define the order of their execution.
- **Number of Paths:** A total of 1000 paths (routes) are employed for conducting forecasts.
